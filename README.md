Multiple http requests by reading multiple files os json

## Overview
This little project is a personal journey in learning how to do multiple requests using many JSON files generated from [this project.](https://github.com/HeyLucasLeao/csv-to-json)


### Usage
Setting .env

To configure your environment, you’ll need to specify three variables:

- JSON_FOLDER: the name of the folder where your generated JSON files are stored.

- HTTP_ENDPOINT: the URL of the endpoint you want to send your requests to.

- BEARER_TOKEN: the bearer token that you will use to authenticate your requests, if needed.
